# To the Wait Line... and Beyond!
Using machine learning techniques in KNIME to predict the wait times of Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin at Walt Disney World

Goals: To deepen knowledge of pandas, machine learning techniques, and KNIME.

### Overview
In this project, I retrieved feature wait time data and feature data from touringplans.com, cleaned and binned the data in Python using the pandas library, and used KNIME to build Artficial Neural Network (ANN) Models, Random Forest models and Logistic Regression models to predict whether the wait time would be "short" (0-15 minutes), "moderate" (20-40 minutes), or "long" (45 minutes +). In the end, I acheived the greatest prediction accuracy with a Random Forest model at 76.4%, with ANN following at 71.7%. Below is a screenshot of my condensed workflow in KNIME, along with a visualization generated from decision tree output depicting the relative importance of different features in generating the prediction model.
